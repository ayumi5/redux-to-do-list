  "readme": "# Object.assign plugin for Babel\n\nBabel plugin that replaces `Object.assign()` with the extends helper.\n\nUseful to reduce the need for additional polyfills or libraries when you want something that extends objects in browsers without native support.\n\nThanks to @sebmck for the implementation.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstead of using `_.extend(obj1, obj2...)` or `xtend(obj1, obj2...)` just use `Object.assign` in your code and include this plugin for Babel.\n\nInstall:\n\n```\n$ npm install babel babel-core babel-plugin-object-assign\n```\n\n_Note:_ you need to specify `babel-core` as a dependency for your project (not just `babel`). This is also true if you are using a wrapper like `babelify`.\n\nUse:\n\n\n```\n$ babel --plugins object-assign script.js\n```\n\nor:\n\n```js\nrequire(\"babel\").transform(\"code\", { plugins: [\"object-assign\"] });\n```\n\nwith `browserify` / `babelify`:\n\n```js\nvar b = browserify({\n  // browserifyoptions\n}).transform(\n  babelify.configure({\n    plugins: [\"object-assign\"]\n  })\n);\n```\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Jed Watson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
